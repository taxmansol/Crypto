The Bitcoin Gospel and onwards

The first cryptocurrency that stuck around was Bitcoin. It stuck around because Bitcoin solved the double spending issue via solving the Byzantine General Problem.
The Byzantine General Problem in simplest terms is
Reach a consensus on a plan of action, even in the face of potential misinformation.

The blockchain was born that was the digital version of the public open ledger. Ledger derived from accounting.

The main goal was to give 2 seperate parties the ability to exchange money without a 3rd party such as a bank or central bank that gave the FIAT currency we use today value. Previous to 1971 FIAT currency was backed by gold in what was known as the gold standard.

The currency we use today isn't truly backed by anything of value, other than the threat of military action from the said nation.
Currency is not money, they are different.

Bitcoin, the first successful cryptocurrency, solved the double spending issue using blockchain technology, which addresses the Byzantine General Problem of reaching consensus in a potentially misleading environment. The blockchain is a public, digital ledger that eliminates the need for third-party intermediaries like banks. Unlike fiat currency, which is backed by the government, Bitcoin is decentralized and not controlled by any single entity.
