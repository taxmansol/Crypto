The first cryptocurrency that stuck around was Bitcoin. It stuck around because Bitcoin solved the double spending issue via solving the Byzantine General Problem.
The Byzantine General Problem in simplest terms is
Reach a consensus on a plan of action, even in the face of potential misinformation.

The blockchain was born that was the digital version of the public open ledger. Ledger derived from accounting.

The main goal was to give 2 seperate parties the ability to exchange money without a 3rd party such as a bank or central bank that gave the FIAT currency we use today value. Previous to 1971 FIAT currency was backed by gold in what was known as the gold standard.

The currency we use today isn't truly backed by anything of value, other than the threat of military action from the said nation.
Currency is not money, they are different.

Bitcoin, the first successful cryptocurrency, solved the double spending issue using blockchain technology, which addresses the Byzantine General Problem of reaching consensus in a potentially misleading environment. The blockchain is a public, digital ledger that eliminates the need for third-party intermediaries like banks. Unlike fiat currency, which is backed by the government, Bitcoin is decentralized and not controlled by any single entity.

The blockchain trilemma, also known as the scalability trilemma, refers to the challenge of achieving all three of the following properties in a blockchain network:

Scalability: The ability to process a large number of transactions per second.
Security: The ability to resist attacks and maintain the integrity of the network.
Decentralization: The distribution of power and decision-making across a large number of participants.

It is generally believed that it is difficult, if not impossible, to achieve all three of these properties simultaneously. If a blockchain network is highly scalable and decentralized, it may be less secure. Conversely, if a blockchain network is highly secure and decentralized, it may be less scalable.


BTC vs SOL

Solana is designed to scale better than Bitcoin due to several key architectural differences:

Proof-of-History (PoH) Consensus: Solana utilizes a unique consensus mechanism called Proof-of-History (PoH) that allows nodes to verify the order of transactions without relying on energy-intensive computations. This enables Solana to process transactions much faster than Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus.

Transaction Parallelization: Solana employs a parallelized transaction processing architecture, which means that multiple transactions can be processed simultaneously. This significantly increases the network's throughput and scalability.

Gulf Stream: Solana introduces a transaction forwarding protocol called Gulf Stream, which efficiently routes transactions to the relevant nodes for processing. This helps to reduce latency and improve the overall performance of the network.

Sealevel: Solana also utilizes a storage technology called Sealevel, which allows nodes to store data off-chain. This helps to reduce the load on the blockchain and enables the network to scale more effectively.

Cloudbreak: Solana's Cloudbreak feature enables horizontal scaling by partitioning the network into smaller clusters. These clusters can process transactions independently, further increasing the network's throughput and scalability.

In summary, Solana's innovative consensus mechanism, parallelized transaction processing, Gulf Stream protocol, Sealevel storage, and Cloudbreak horizontal scaling capabilities collectively contribute to its superior scalability compared to Bitcoin. These features allow Solana to handle a significantly higher load.

Decentralization:

Bitcoin: Bitcoin is a highly decentralized cryptocurrency. Its network is maintained by a large number of independent nodes distributed worldwide. No single entity or group has control over the network, making it resistant to censorship and manipulation.

Solana: While Solana is also decentralized, it has a more centralized architecture compared to Bitcoin. The network is governed by a smaller set of validators, which raises concerns about potential centralization and the possibility of censorship or manipulation by a dominant group.

Censorship Resistance:

Bitcoin: Bitcoin is known for its strong censorship resistance. Transactions on the Bitcoin network are immutable once they are confirmed, meaning they cannot be reversed or altered. This makes Bitcoin a valuable tool for individuals seeking to protect their assets from censorship or confiscation.

Solana: Solana's censorship resistance is not as strong as Bitcoin's due to its more centralized architecture. In theory, a dominant group of validators could collude to censor or manipulate transactions on the network. However, it's important to note that Solana's validators are spread across different jurisdictions, making it challenging for a single entity to gain control over the network.

Overall, Bitcoin has a clear advantage in terms of decentralization and censorship resistance compared to Solana. Bitcoin's larger and more distributed network, coupled with its immutable transaction history, makes it a more robust and censorship-resistant cryptocurrency.
